Hello everybody!

Here attached is census data for USA already cleaned by age group which was used for a project with USTA. This open census information was extracted from Safegraph open census data and cleaned after.

The data is divided by age group and by County.

The csv file contains the next fields:

add_county_code: County code
STNAME: State name
CTYNAME: County name

The next fields are the total, male and female population by age.

Hope this is useful for someone!
